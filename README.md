# End-to-End-Azure-Data-Engineering-Real-Time-Project

let's build a complete End to End Azure Data Engineering Project. In this project we are going to create an end to end data platform right from Data Ingestion, Data Transformation, Data Loading and Reporting.



The tools that are covered in this project are,



Azure Data Factory

Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2

Azure Databricks

Azure Synapse Analytics

Azure Key vault

Microsoft Entra ID (Previously called as AAD) and

Microsoft Power BI



The use case for this project is building an end to end solution by ingesting the tables from on-premise SQL Server database using Azure Data Factory and then store the data in Azure Data Lake. Then Azure databricks is used to transform the RAW data to the most cleanest form of data and then we are using Azure Synapse Analytics to load the clean data and finally using Microsoft Power BI to integrate with Azure synapse analytics to build an interactive dashboard. Also, we are using Microsoft Entra ID ( Previously called as AAD) and Azure Key Vault for the monitoring and governance purpose. In this video, I have also covered the complete end to end pipeline testing right from how a new data gets ingested followed by the data transformation until it goes updating the report that we will be creating using the Power BI
